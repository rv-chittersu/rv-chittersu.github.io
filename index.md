	* Developed an application to detect malfunctioning of APIs based on current and past metrics. 
	* The app actively queries New Relic data and notifies the team through slack in case of anomaly detection.


# Projects

* EXTRAS: Exploring TRansformers for Abstractive Summarization, 2019
	* Implemented transformer architecture for abstract summarization task.
	* Integrated pointer generator mechanism on top of transformer.

* Artificial Intelligence in Race Car, 2015
